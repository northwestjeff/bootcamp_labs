<!---# Lab: Bio

Your HTML file should be named `index.html` in that directory.

Write up a short bio webpage for yourself or someone famous.
Include:

* A written introduction
* A link to their favorite Wikipedia article in that introduction
* A picture of them (or a placeholder)
* A list of places where they've lived
* A quote from them
* Proper structuring HTML elements

The point of this project is _not_ to make something that looks pretty (and it won't), it is just to have good structure.

## Advanced

* Peruse the [complete HTML element list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) and try to incorporate some of them.
